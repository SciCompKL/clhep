# Differentiated CLHEP

This is a version of the [CLHEP](https://gitlab.cern.ch/CLHEP/CLHEP) library for high-energy physics with support for forward-mode algorithmic differentiation using the [EasyAD](https://github.com/SciCompKL/easyAD) tool. It is used by our [differentiated version of Geant4](https://github.com/SciCompKL/geant4).
